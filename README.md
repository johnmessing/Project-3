## About
​
The project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of historical cryptocurrency data, enabling users to make informed decisions. Leveraging Pycoingecko for data retrieval, Darts for time series forecasting, and Streamlit for the user interface ensures a powerful and user-friendly experience. The tool aligns with the objective of empowering users with insights into cryptocurrency trends.
Methodology:
 Use Pycoingecko to retrieve historical cryptocurrency data.
Apply Darts time series forecasting to analyze trends. Integrate algorithmic trading functionalities for automated trade execution.
Develop a Streamlit user interface for interactive visualization.



Machine Learning: is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. 

Visualization: Matplotlib  will be used to create informative visualizations. This will include line charts  to make complex data more accessible.

Pandas Data Analysis: Pandas will be utilized for data cleaning, manipulation, and statistical analysis to answer research questions and provide relevant insights.





​
## Getting Started
​
Explain how to get your project up and running on the user's local machine.
​
### Prerequisites
​​
Python (v3.6 or higher)
​
### Installation
​

​​
Necessary dependencies:
​
​npm install 
pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas
pip install pathlib
pip install mplfinance
 pip install numpy
conda install -c dartsim dart
pip install streamlit
pip install pygecko

​
## Usage
​
In the majority of cases, the end user of an application is not a person who has knowledge in the programming area. This is why developing an analysis tool with an easy-to-use interface is so crucial.
The objective of the Bit Prfot is to make accessible financial analysis for people who are not versed in the programming area but have knowledge in the financial field.
The use of Yahoo Finance gives the application an always 'up-to-date' information data source, which serves as a future-proofs design.
